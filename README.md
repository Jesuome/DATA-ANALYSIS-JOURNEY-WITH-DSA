# DATA-ANALYSIS-JOURNEY-WITH-DSA
## A Portfolio on my experience and learning pace as a beginener in Data Analysis with Incubator Hub (Digital Skill-Up Africa).

### Project Overview

This repository documents my learning journey in **Data Analysis** as part of the **Digital Skill-Up Africa** program. The programm is broken into three sessions which learning tools are Excel, SQL and Power BI. This programmes is aimed at grooming participant as Beginners into the tech space and to also prepare for real world data roles.  

### Weekly Progress

#### Week 1:
**overview of Data Analysis**

1. Data Generation
2. The systems every organization runs on ( Operational and Analytical Systems)
3. Data Storage (on premise and in the cloud).
4. The different structures of data
5. Data Analysis cycle; Ingestion - Transformation - Modeling - Visualization - Analysis - Presentation.  

**Introduction to Excel - Excel Function 1**
 
 Over view of the Ribbon interface, groups, tabs etc on Excel
 1. The AVERAGE, SUM, COUNT, COUNTA, LARGE, MAX, MIN FUNCTIONS
 2. THE Functional argument ( optional and mandatory argument)
 3. Learnt that arrays means a list of values
 4. The most fascinating lesson of the class was learning how to us **ALT= Function**. 

**Excel Fuction 2**
  
 1. The Sister Functions of the functions learnt in the 2nd class ( AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFs, SUMIF, SUMIFs, COUNTIF, COUNTIFs E.t.c).
 2. Explored the Extraction Functions which are: FIND, MID, RIGHT, SEARCH Functions.
 3. The TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, PROPER Functions were also taught
 4. CONCATENATION Function ( the joining of text together like first name and last names to get full names)
 5. My highlight for the class was the NESTING Function; using multiple function for one calculation in excel.

#### Week 2:
**Excel Function 3**
  1. IF Functions: It is a fundamental logical function use to create a dynamic calculation based on a different outcome.
  2. AND Function: It is a logical function that evaluates multiple conditions
  3. OR Function: This is the opposite of the AND Function. The OR function is not strict like the AND Function, it is not neccessary for both condition to be met. If one icondition is met it will return true.
