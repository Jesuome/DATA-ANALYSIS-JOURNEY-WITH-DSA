# DATA-ANALYSIS-JOURNEY-WITH-DSA
## A Portfolio on my experience and learning pace as a beginener in Data Analysis with Incubator Hub (Digital Skill-Up Africa).

### Project Overview

This repository documents my learning journey in **Data Analysis** as part of the **Digital Skill-Up Africa** program. The programm is broken into three sessions which learning tools are Excel, SQL and Power BI. This programmes is aimed at grooming participant as Beginners into the tech space and to also prepare for real world data roles.  

### Weekly Progress

#### Week 1:
**overview of Data Analysis**

1. Data Generation
2. The systems every organization runs on ( Operational and Analytical Systems)
3. Data Storage (on premise and in the cloud).
4. The different structures of data
5. Data Analysis cycle; Ingestion - Transformation - Modeling - Visualization - Analysis - Presentation.  

**Introduction to Excel - Excel Function 1**
 
 Over view of the Ribbon interface, groups, tabs etc on Excel
 1. The AVERAGE, SUM, COUNT, COUNTA, LARGE, MAX, MIN FUNCTIONS
 2. THE Functional argument ( optional and mandatory argument)
 3. Learnt that arrays means a list of values
 4. The most fascinating lesson of the class was learning how to us **ALT= Function**. 

**Excel Fuction 2**
  
 1. The Sister Functions of the functions learnt in the 2nd class ( AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFs, SUMIF, SUMIFs, COUNTIF, COUNTIFs E.t.c).
 2. Explored the Extraction Functions which are: FIND, MID, RIGHT, SEARCH Functions.
 3. The TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, PROPER Functions were also taught
 4. CONCATENATION Function ( the joining of text together like first name and last names to get full names)
 5. My highlight for the class was the NESTING Function; using multiple function for one calculation in excel.

#### Week 2:
**Excel Function 3**
  1. IF Functions: It is a fundamental logical function use to create a dynamic calculation based on a different outcome.
  2. AND Function: It is a logical function that evaluates multiple conditions
  3. OR Function: This is the opposite of the AND Function. The OR function is not strict like the AND Function, it is not neccessary for both condition to be met. If one icondition is met it will return true.


**Excel Function 4**

The DATES Functions 
 1. The TODAY Function
 2. NOW Function
 3. YEAR Function
 4. MONTH Function
 5. DAY Function
 6. TEXT Function
 7. DATEDIF Function
It Fascinating to know Excel sees dates as numbers and it begins counting from 1st January 1900

**VLOOKUP**

This consist of various lookup function which conisit of 
1. VLOOKUP Function
2. HLOOKUP Function
3. XLOOKUP Function
4. INDEX Function
5. MATCH Function
6. XMATCH Function etc.

Cell Referencing: Relative Referencing, Absolute Referencing, Column Constant and Row Constant.

#### Week 4:
**Pivot Table**

A Data summarization tool consisting of Filters, Column, Rows, Values. Data can be Qualitative (Categorical) and Quantitative (Numerical).

The IF Function and the Pivot Table are very interesting. The IF Function is so versatile and the Pivot Table makes analysis easy. My favourite tool in Excel. 

The second class of Pivot Table marked the final class on excel. we had a hands on pratical on:
 1. How to add the same column twice in a pivot table
 2. Switching from sum to average, % of Grand Total, minimum and more.
 3. Working with the layout group
 4. Creating the pivot chart with ease (ALT+F1)
 5. Custom Formatting.

Navigating Pivot Chart Analysis and Design brought out the beauty of Data Cleaning on Excel.
